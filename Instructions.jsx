      <p>This instructions page assumes you have finished reading the book and are now interested in playing the Entanglement Game!
      <br/> The idea is that you will be given a set of qubits in either an entangled state or a product state.
      <br/> Your goal is to determine whether the qubits are entangled or not by expanding the equations.
      <br/> You can use the book provided as a reference to help you with the expansions.

      <br/> Things to keep in mind:
      <br/> - Entangled states cannot be factored into the product of individual qubit states.
      <br/> - Product states can be expressed as the product of individual qubit states.
      <br/> - Use the arbitrary equation: |ψ⟩ = a|00⟩ + b|01⟩ + c|10⟩ + d|11⟩ to help you visualize the states.
      <br/> Hopefully you enjoy and have fun!<br/>
